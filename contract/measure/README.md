## Execution Time Measurement

This tool is used to measure the time spent to execute Lua functions

It is used for both base Lua functions (BF) and Aergo Lua Functions (AEF)

### Note

As it was failing to run the AEF functions with 1000 iteration, it was
decreased to 100.

So the measured time for the Lua functions refers to a different amount
of iterations:

* Base Lua: 1000
* Aergo Lua: 100
